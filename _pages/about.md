Hi, my name is Yama Jiang. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science through the Accelerated BS-MS program at the University of Central Florida. My interests lie in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’m passionate about exploring how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems. While I’m still expanding my expertise, I’m highly motivated to learn and grow within the rapidly evolving tech industry. I’m actively seeking opportunities to develop professionally in dynamic, challenging environments where I can contribute meaningfully and continue to build my skills.

Bio
------
Before college, I attended NeoCity Academy, an inquiry-driven, project-based STEM Choice Program. As part of the Engineering pathway, I engaged in a wide range of hands-on, interdisciplinary projects that emphasized critical thinking, collaboration, and innovation. I graduated in 2022 with a weighted GPA of 4.47, reflecting both my academic excellence and dedication to challenging coursework. Through its unique curriculum, I gained valuable experience in areas such as engineering design, research, data analysis, and technical communication

I started my education at the University of Central Florida as a marketing major, but eventually switched to computer science due to my passion for problem solving and my desire to build innovative, technology-driven solutions. I realized that computer science aligned more closely with my strengths in logic, creativity, and analytical thinking, while offering the opportunity to create and work towards a real-world impact.

I'm currently in my junior year at the University of Central Florida, where I’ve been accepted into the accelerated BS-MS program. I plan to continue my education by pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science after completing my bachelor’s, with a focus on specializing in and deepening my expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, cooking, and self-teaching new topics to expand my knowledge and skills. Recently, I've started teaching myself linear algebra, as it plays a fundamental role in understanding and applying machine learning.

I am currently seeking research or internship opportunities where I can apply and expand my skills in computer science, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I’m eager to gain hands-on experience by contributing to real-world projects, collaborating with experienced professionals, and continuing to learn through practical application. I believe these opportunities will allow me to further develop my technical abilities while making meaningful contributions to innovative projects.
