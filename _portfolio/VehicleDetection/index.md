This small vehicle detection project is used to detect and count vehicles in videos, such as those captured on highways or from surveillance footage. By leveraging the YOLOv8 object detection model, it processes each frame of the video in real time, identifies and labels detected vehicles, and overlays bounding boxes along with object counts on the video. This tool can be useful for traffic analysis, smart city monitoring, or automating vehicle counting for data-driven urban planning.
