This project marked my first experience with game design and development. I used Unity and C# to create a pink-themed version of Flappy Bird, designing all the game graphics myself. Through this process, I learned the fundamentals of game physics, collision detection, and user input handling. It was an exciting introduction to interactive development and sparked my passion for building engaging digital experiences.
