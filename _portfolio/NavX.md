NavX is a small-scale autonomous robot built for the Introduction to Robotics (EGN4060C) course at the University of Central Florida. Developed in collaboration with a teammate, NavX is capable of obstacle avoidance and object recognition, combining embedded systems and machine learning into a functional navigation system.

This project gave us practical experience with real-time sensor integration, robot assembly, and object detection using the YOLOv8 model.
