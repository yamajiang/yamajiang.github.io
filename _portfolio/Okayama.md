I designed and developed a website for Okayama, a hibachi-style Japanese sushi restaurant located in Orlando, FL, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface that effectively showcases the restaurant’s menu, ambiance, and contact details. I focused on intuitive navigation and interactive features to enhance the user experience. This project gave me the opportunity to apply my front-end development skills while capturing and communicating the restaurant’s unique brand and atmosphere.
